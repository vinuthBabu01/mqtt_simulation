### **MQTT Sensor Simulator for ThingSpeak**  

#### **IoT MQTT Simulation**  
**IoT Environmental Monitoring – MQTT & ThingSpeak**  
This project simulates a virtual environmental sensor station using Python and MQTT to transmit data to ThingSpeak.  

#### **Key Features**  
- Generates simulated readings for temperature, humidity, and CO₂  
- Publishes real-time sensor data to ThingSpeak via MQTT  
- Stores all collected data locally for offline access  

#### **Technologies Used**  
- Python 3  
- paho-mqtt  
- ThingSpeak MQTT Broker  

#### **Project Files**  
- **mqtt_publish.py** – Main script for simulating and publishing sensor data    
- **sensor_log.txt** – Log file storing sensor readings  

#### **How to Run**  
1. Install required dependencies.  
2. Update `mqtt_publish.py` with the correct MQTT credentials.  
3. Run the script and monitor live data on your ThingSpeak channel.
